# IDEAS

Collection of ideas for improving the project. Feel free to open a PR with new ones, please.

- Allow for upload of GIFs or JPEGS
- Reorganize the repo README.MD to be more straightforward and less prone to error
- Better standard UI (thinking about open sourcing the https://worldcities.aiphotos.art/ UI)
- Removal of the Metaplex CLI (thus creating a small NextJS service that uses the Metaplex JS library to create the candy machine and all other tasks, like uploading images) OR integrate this project or suggest to do the part of minting stuff https://github.com/InnerMindDAO/MintUI
- Add captcha to prevent bots
